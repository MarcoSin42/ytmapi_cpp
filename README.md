This is C++ YouTube Music api based loosely off of the Python [YTM API](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi/tree/621584be3ca28d19667fc7c6353fab9ff09b7fa6).

I made this so I could use it in my terminal-user interface YouTube Music player.  

Rather than using YouTube's public data API, this library emulates browser requests because YouTube does not yet provide a publicly available API for YouTube Music.
